> Cyberpunk has already arrived; it is here, blooming and evolving gracefully every single moment since being introduced to reality. It will not disappear but will most likely be regulated. My personal goal as a software engineer is to harness AI to utilize all its benefits and strengths. It is an inevitable part of my toolsetâ€”my helper and driver of curiosity, a materializer of my theoretical technical knowledge.
> Proficient and interested in numerous programming languages and paradigms. Passionate about Java, Golang, Rust, the functional programming paradigm, and systems programming, particularly in application development.
